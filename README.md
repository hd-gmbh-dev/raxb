# RAXB

The Rust Architecture for XML Binding (`RAXB`) provides an API and tools that automate the mapping between XML documents and Rust structures.

## Legal

Licensed under `MIT` license.

## Features

The RAXB framework enables developers to perform the following operations:

- Unmarshal XML content into a Rust representation
- Access and update the Rust representation
- Marshal the Rust representation of the XML content into XML content

RAXB gives Rust developers an efficient and standard way of mapping between XML and Rust code. Rust developers using RAXB are more productive because they can write less code themselves and do not have to be experts in XML. RAXB makes it easier for developers to extend their applications with XML and Web Services technologies.

## Usage

Add dependency to Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
raxb = "0.4"
```

## Development

The project is using Rust, JavaScript and TypeScript to provide its functionality.

To simplify project setup one can use Visual Studio Code with DevContainers feature enabled.
